# The Question

"What kind of software does a small business typically use?"

# Our Answer


Great question! It’s best to think of what the different “departments” are for a startup.

For account management, you will want to use a CRM. I use [Hubspot](https://hubspot.com)’s free CRM. It’s full featured.

For your website you can’t go wrong with [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org), my favorite host for wordpress is [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com).

For sales, you will want to use a sales automation tool. This sends automated emails out to your target clients. I use [Apollo.io](https://apollo.io).

For marketing, you will want to set up [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com), [Google Adwords](https://ads.google.com) and a marketing automation platform to handle your bulk email sends. [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) and [Sharpspring](https://sharpspring.com) are good choices.

For accounting and bookkeeping, I recommend [wave](https://waveapps.com) or [quickbooks](https://quickbooks.com).

For email and file sharing, [Gsuite](https://gsuite.google.com) and [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) are my go-to solutions.

For HR and recruiting, I recommend [Freshteam](https://freshteam.com) or [Gusto](https://gusto.com)

For phone systems, I usually set up a custom solution with a voice menu built with [Twilio](https://twilio.com)

For workflow automation, tying all of these systems together, I recommend [Zapier](https://zapier.com) - an extremely powerful workflow automation tool

To automate appointment setting, I recommend [Calendly](https://calendly.com).

For an internal platform, I recommend hiring a consultant to build you a custom application deployed on [heroku](https://heroku.com). This platform will streamline your business processes which pays dividends over the long run.

Let me know if you need help setting anything up. I help companies set up their tech all the time.
