        <h1 class="header-intro">The Arcanium Academy</h1>
        <p>
          Most bootcamps don't work. They cram too much material into too short of a time period. There's not enough one-on-one teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the Arcanium Academy you will receive a well rounded education that will have future employers excited to hire you. We have a thorough focus on proper software design, open source, startups, UNIX philosophy and modern web development. We provide individualized, one-on-one mentorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe it shouldn't break your bank to learn software, so we provide internships to our full time students to earn-while-you-learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          We built the Arcanium Academy because we have a passion for changing lifes. We truly want to help you change your career and change your life. If you are willing to put in the hard work, we will have your back and personally commit to helping you succeed.

        <h1 class="journeyman">Job Placement</h1>
        <p>
          Once an adept has worked on several projects in industry and contributed meaningfully, they should naturally progress towards
          helping other mages. They should also find themselves increasingly able to take on higher level projects. As the scope of a mage's work
          grows, they will progress to Journeyman. Though they have graduated the Arcanium, it is expected that they will remain a member to share their
          increasing knowledge with junior wizards.
