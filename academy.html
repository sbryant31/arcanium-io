          <h1 class="header-intro">The Arcanium Academy</h1>
          <p>
            Most bootcamps are too expensive and too short. Getting a computer science degree takes four years and costs an arm and a leg. So we decided to try something different.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Arcanium Academy is a 1-2 year apprenticeship program for web developers. At the Arcanium Academy you will receive a well rounded education that will have future employers begging to hire you. You will also get your hands dirty on real life development tasks, open source contribnutions and launching startup products.. We provide individualized, one-on-one mentorship. Heck, we've even been known to offer a place to stay while you learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            We built the Arcanium Academy because we have a passion for changing lives. We know how intimidating becoming a software developer is. With our community and mentorship, you will always know that we have your back. I guarantee it. So what will you learn?
          </p>
