      <h2 class="theacademy">The Academy</h2>
      <p>
        We're biased. We think coding is an awesome job. But not when you are using boring tools in a boring environment. We aim to directly transmit the things we think are
        cool about programming. And for us that means playing with open source software in terminals, hacking anything we dream up. We also really care about the company of others
        and being part of a community dedicated to doing cool stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our curriculum is a bit abnormal compared to your typical code school. We place a very large emphasis on development environment and mindset. We believe in
        teaching advanced concepts up front and trusting wizards to learn as they go. If nothing else, our goal is to teach you to take nothing seriously, while taking everything seriously, and realizing that you already know how to code.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only requirement for joining the Academy is a willingness to put everything you think you know about programming aside and open your mind
      </p>

      <h3 class="initiate">Initiate Level</h3>
      <p>
        During your time as an initiate you will learn what it means to be a programmer of UNIX heritage. You'll learn that, while coding is a large
        portion of what we do, there are many other things that a smart coder can do. You'll learn Node/React, a common and valuable modern stack.
        At this level you should understand the entire software stack from frontend to backend to server deployment. You should also be prepared to
        customize your dev environment.

      <h3 class="apprentice">Apprentice Level</h3>
      <p>
        As an apprentice, you'll begin to put your theory into practice, working on real world code projects.
        This will include both open source publications and potentially, an internship. During this time you will be
        continually mentored by a senior mage. By the end of this arc, you should be prepared for an entry level
        software development job.
      </p>

        <li>Getting things done</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="adept">Adept Level</h4>
      <p>
        Adept is the title we give to our mages once they graduate to their first software development job.
        A successful adept will realize their journey is just beginning, and they have an infinite amount of arcane knowledge left to acquire.
        The cornerstone to success as an adept is to analyze your own code critically and to work in situations where you have oversight of your own work.
        At this stage, it is hard to trust your own magic. Those your spells may get the job done, they may still backfire.
      </p>

      <h4 class="red-color">Absorbing the Literature</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Hackers and painters</li>
        <li>Data intensive systems</li>
        <li>Design Patterns - Gang of four</li>
        <li>Code Complete</li>
        <li>The Pragmatic Programmer</li>
        <li>Secrets of the Javascript Ninja</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="red-color">Second Language (optional)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Elixir</li>
        <li>LISP</li>
        <li>Clojure</li>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>Rust</li>
        <li>Go</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="journeyman">Journeyman and beyond</h3>
      <p>
        Once an adept has worked on several projects in industry and contributed meaningfully, they should naturally progress towards
        helping other mages. They should also find themselves increasingly able to take on higher level projects. As the scope of a mage's work
        grows, they will progress to Journeyman. Though they have graduated the Arcanium, it is expected that they will remain a member to share their
        increasing knowledge with junior wizards.
