          <h1 class="header-intro">Bootcamps don't work</h1>
          <p>
            If you're reading this you want to become a programmer. Your choices are:
            <ul>
              <li>Learn by yourself - requires mad discipline</li>
              <li>Join a code bootcamp - over $10k for a short program with questionable results</li>
              <li>Get a computer science degree - more than $10k for several years and most of the learning is impractical</li>
              <li><span class="cta">Join the Arcanium Academy as an apprentice!</span></li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h1 class="header-intro">Apprenticeships work pretty well</h1>
          <p>
            If you want to become an electrician, you're not going to go to a bootcamp. You're not going to learn it by yourself (you might explode). And there are no four year degrees. You have to become an apprentice. Apprenticeships are one of the oldest forms of training. You work, you learn, and you get paid. Makes sense to me.
          </p>

          <h1 class="header-intro">The Arcanium Academy</h1>
          <p>
            The Arcanium Academy is a 1-2 year apprenticeship program for web developers. At the Arcanium Academy you will receive a well rounded education that will deeply prepare you for the software development industry. You will also get your hands dirty on real life development tasks, open source contributions and real life projects. Rather than treat you like a child, you will be part of our team. Your program will be indiviualized to your interests and skill level. I assure you, anyone with dedication can become a professional programmer.
          </p>
